Most group recommendation methods concentrated on dealing with persistent groups, while little attention has paid to ephemeral groups. Ephemeral groups are formed ad-hoc for one-time activities, and therefore they suffer severely from data sparsity and cold-start problems. To deal with such problems, we propose a pre-training and fine-tuning method called GBERT for improved group recommendations, which employs BERT to enhance the expressivity and capture group-specific preferences of members. In the pre-training stage, GBERT employs three pre-training tasks to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problem, and learn better user representations. In the fine-tuning stage, an influence-based regulation objective is designed to regulate user and group representations by allocating weights according to each member's influence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods for ephemeral group recommendations.},\n",

    "abstract = {As a step beyond traditional personalized recommendation, group recommendation is the task of suggesting items that can satisfy a group of users. In group recommendation, the core is to design preference aggregation functions to obtain a quality summary of all group members' preferences. Such user and group preferences are commonly represented as points in the vector space (i.e., embeddings), where multiple user embeddings are compressed into one to facilitate ranking for group-item pairs. However, the resulted group representations, as points, lack adequate flexibility and capacity to account for the multi-faceted user preferences. Also, the point embedding-based preference aggregation is a less faithful reflection of a group's decision-making process, where all users have to agree on a certain value in each embedding dimension instead of a negotiable interval. In this paper, we propose a novel representation of groups via the notion of hypercubes, which are subspaces containing innumerable points in the vector space. Specifically, we design the hypercube recommender (CubeRec) to adaptively learn group hypercubes from user embeddings with minimal information loss during preference aggregation, and to leverage a revamped distance metric to measure the affinity between group hypercubes and item points. Moreover, to counteract the long-standing issue of data sparsity in group recommendation, we make full use of the geometric expressiveness of hypercubes and innovatively incorporate self-supervision by intersecting two groups. Experiments on four real-world datasets have validated the superiority of CubeRec over state-of-the-art baselines.},\n",

    "abstract = {Group recommendation aims to suggest preferred items to a group of users rather than to an individual user. Most existing methods on group recommendation directly learn theinherent interests of groups and users orinherent features of items, i.e., independently modeling the inherent embeddings of groups, users or items. However, the independent view severely suffers from the cold-start problem when making recommendations for occasional groups that are temporally formed by a set of users and have few interactions on items. Actually, the groups, users and items are interdependent because they interact with one another. The interdependencies constitute an interaction graph that provides multiple views to model the embeddings of groups, users and items from their interacting counterparts to improve recommendation for occasional groups. To this end, we propose a model, named GAME to learn the Graphical and Attentive Multi-view Embeddings (i.e., representations) for the groups, users and items from the independent view and counterpart views based on the interaction graph. In the counterpart views, the embedding of a group, user or item is aggregated from the interacting counterparts based on an attention mechanism that derives the adaptive weight for each counterpart. For instance, a user's embedding may be aggregated from her interacting items or groups. Further, GAME applies neural collaborative filtering to investigate the interactions between the multi-view embeddings of groups (or users) and items for group recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real datasets. The experimental results show that GAME outperforms other state-of-the-art models, especially on both cold-start groups (i.e., occasional groups) and cold-start items.},\n",

Existing studies target persistent groups with substantial activity history, while ephemeral groups lack historical interactions. To overcome group interaction sparsity, we propose data-driven regularization strategies to exploit both the preference covariance amongst users who are in the same group, as well as the contextual relevance of users' individual preferences to each group.We make two contributions. First, we present a recommender architecture-agnostic framework GroupIM that can integrate arbitrary neural preference encoders and aggregators for ephemeral group recommendation. Second, we regularize the user-group latent space to overcome group interaction sparsity by: maximizing mutual information between representations of groups and group members; and dynamically prioritizing the preferences of highly informative members through contextual preference weighting. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets indicate significant performance improvements (31-62\\% relative NDCG@20) over state-of-the-art group recommendation techniques.},\n",

    "abstract = {This paper proposes Medley of Sub-Attention Networks (MoSAN), a new novel neural architecture for the group recommendation task. Group-level recommendation is known to be a challenging task, in which intricate group dynamics have to be considered. As such, this is to be contrasted with the standard recommendation problem where recommendations are personalized with respect to a single user. Our proposed approach hinges upon the key intuition that the decision making process (in groups) is generally dynamic, i.e., a user's decision is highly dependent on the other group members. All in all, our key motivation manifests in a form of an attentive neural model that captures fine-grained interactions between group members. In our MoSAN model, each sub-attention module is representative of a single member, which models a user's preference with respect to all other group members. Subsequently, a Medley of Sub-Attention modules is then used to collectively make the group's final decision. Overall, our proposed model is both expressive and effective. Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that MoSAN not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also improves standard baselines by a considerable margin.},\n",

Much of the existing work considers hypothetical consumption scenarios, and commonly, individual ratings are aggregated, but no actual group consumption takes place in which situational differences per group are taken into account. In this paper, we outline a vision for acquiring more realistic and ecological group consumption data, based on a crowdsourcing application that will acquire individual ratings per group consumption event. We discuss various design decisions that will allow us to gather these ratings effectively from a large group of people, and demonstrate and evaluate the viability of our approach towards reaching group consensus through rating session simulations.\",\n",

However, while considerable research in group recommendation has been performed, we still lack truly ecological datasets on group recommendations in real life consumption scenarios. Much of the existing work considers hypothetical consumption scenarios, and commonly, individual ratings are aggregated, but no actual group consumption takes place in which situational differences per group are taken into account. In this paper, we outline a vision for acquiring more realistic and ecological group consumption data, based on a crowdsourcing application that will acquire individual ratings per group consumption event. We discuss various design decisions that will allow us to gather these ratings effectively from a large group of people, and demonstrate and evaluate the viability of our approach towards reaching group consensus through rating session simulations.\",\\nkeywords = \"Crowd sourcing, Datasets, Group recommendation\",\\nauthor = \"Matthijs Rijlaarsdam and Sebastiaan Scholten and Liem, {Cynthia C.S.}\",\\nyear = \"2019\",\\nlanguage = \"English\",\\nseries = \"CEUR Workshop Proceedings\",\\npublisher = \"CEUR-WS\",\\npages = \"1--5\",\\neditor = \"Shalom, {Oren Sar } and Dietmar Jannach and {Guy }, {Ido }\",\\nbooktitle = \"ImpactRS 2019 Impact of Recommender Systems 2019\",\\nnote = \"1st Workshop on the Impact of Recommender Systems, ImpactRS 2019 ; Conference date: 19-09-2019 Through 19-09-2019\",\\n}\\n\n",
